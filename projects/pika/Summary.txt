Pika, a friendly robot is being designed which can talk and move. The aim is to create a robot which will act as kids guardian in case parents are busy. The robot can answer "wh" type  questions like why, who, how, where, when or simple general knowledge questions. Studies show that a curriculum created with the integration of digital media can improve initial literacy skills, concentration, and multitasking. So it will help kids to retain more knowledge. Also a portal for parents is being designed which will help them track their kid's activity and which will allow them customize Pika according to their will such as adding reminders and modifying Pika's knowledge base. Pika will be integrated with live feed so that parents can monitor their child. Parents receive notifications on whatsapp as well as through email.
